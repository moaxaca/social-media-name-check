# Go Social Media Name Checker
I am experimenting with golang and wanted to try out
some of the concurrency features of go. Overall I am really surprised with how
much I enjoy the language. With go routines threading can be extremely easy & intuitive
to write.

## The App
The application asynchronously call defined social networks and reads the response status
to determine if a name is in available.
